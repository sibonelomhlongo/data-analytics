Descriptive Analytics: Descriptive analytics focuses on summarizing historical data to understand what has happened in the past. 
It includes techniques such as data visualization, summary statistics, and exploratory data analysis.

Predictive Analytics: Predictive analytics utilizes historical data to forecast future events or outcomes. 
Techniques such as regression analysis, time series analysis, and machine learning algorithms like decision trees 
and neural networks are commonly used in predictive analytics.

Prescriptive Analytics: Prescriptive analytics goes beyond predicting future outcomes to recommend actions that can 
optimize those outcomes. Optimization techniques, simulation models, and decision analysis are commonly employed in 
prescriptive analytics.

Numeric Data Types:
Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without decimal points. For example, 1, 100, -5.

Float/Double (float/double): Represents numbers with decimal points. For example, 3.14, -0.001, 1000.05.

Decimal: Similar to float/double but with fixed precision. Useful for financial calculations.

Text Data Types:
String (str): Represents sequences of characters. For example, "Hello, World!", "123abc".

Character (char): Represents a single character. Used in languages like C and C++.

Boolean Data Type:
Boolean (bool): Represents logical values of True or False. Often used in conditional statements and comparisons.

Date and Time Data Types:
Date: Represents dates without time information. For example, 2024-04-10.

Time: Represents time without date information. For example, 10:30:00.
DateTime: Represents both date and time together. For example, 2024-04-10 10:30:00.

Timestamp: Represents a specific moment in time, often measured as the number of seconds or milliseconds since a reference point.

Categorical Data Types:
Ordinal: Represents data with a natural ordering. For example, rankings (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

Nominal: Represents data with no inherent ordering. For example, colors (red, blue, green).

Binary Data Types:
Binary: Represents binary data, such as images, audio files, or any other non-text data.

Structured Data Types:
Arrays: Represents collections of items of the same type, organized in a linear sequence.

Lists: Represents collections of items that can be of different types, often with flexible length.

Tuples: Similar to lists but immutable (cannot be modified after creation).

Dictionaries/Maps: Represents collections of key-value pairs, allowing fast retrieval of values based on keys.

Geospatial Data Types:
Point: Represents a single geographical point defined by latitude and longitude coordinates.

LineString: Represents a sequence of points forming a line.

Polygon: Represents a closed shape defined by a sequence of points.

JSON/XML Data Types:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): Represents structured data using JavaScript syntax, commonly used for exchanging data between a 
server and a web application.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language): Represents structured data using markup tags, commonly used for storing and exchanging data in a 
platform-independent manner.

Custom Data Types:
Data types specific to certain programming languages, frameworks, or applications, defined by users or developers as per their 
requirements.
