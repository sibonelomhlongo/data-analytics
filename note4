Data Manipulation
When manipulating data, one of four possible actions occurs:

Create new data.
Read existing data.
Update existing data.
Delete existing data.
The acronym CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is a handy way to remember these four operations.

SQL uses verbs to identify the type of activity a specific statement performs. For each CRUD activity, there is a corresponding DML 
verb, as Table 3.8 illustrates. These verbs are known as keywords or words that are part of the SQL language itself.
